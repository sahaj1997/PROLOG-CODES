1. Simplify the given expression to it's normal form.
2. Equates two expressions by their normal forms.


Meanings of predicates defined in the program:
1.simplifyExp : recursively simplifes the expression.
2.num(X) : checks if X is an integer.

Note : Please add expression terms in lowercase and result in upper case due to singleton
variable.

Entry format : 

simplifyExp(exp, res):
exp computes the expressions and res stores the result.

equals(e1,e2):
compares e1 and e2.
